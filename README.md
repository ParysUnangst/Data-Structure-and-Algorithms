Data Structures and Algorithms Repository
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains a collection of assignments
and implementations focused on fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms. These exercises aim to provide 
practical experience and enhance your understanding of various data structures and algorithmic techniques.


Introduction
This repository is a comprehensive collection of assignments related to data structures and algorithms.
Each assignment includes a detailed explanation of the problem statement, the implemented solution, and test
cases to validate the correctness of the solution. The assignments cover a wide range of topics including recursion, stack operations, text editing, and more.


Recursion
  Definition and explanation of recursion
  Comparison with iteration
  Real-world applications
  Challenges and limitations
  Favorite recursive algorithm
  
Simple Text Editor
  Implementation of a text editor that supports adding text, deleting the last character, and undoing the last operation using a stack data structure.

Additional Assignments
  More assignments related to data structures and algorithms will be added periodically.




Getting Started
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the official website.

Usage
Each assignment is contained within its own directory. Navigate to the directory of the assignment you want to explore and run the Python script to see the implementation in action.

For example, to run the Simple Text Editor assignment:

bash
Copy code
cd simple-text-editor
python simple_text_editor.py
